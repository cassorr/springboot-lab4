I was able to get `Product Service` running and working, but I was having difficulties with `Order Service` and `Inventory Service`. I could not get some Lombok annotations to be recognized properly. I tried deleting the ones that were not being recognized, and then ones that were recognized would then not be recognized the next time I compiled. I tried everything from reloading maven projects, restarting my caching, edit my dependencies, open the project in multiple IDE's, etc. I do have all the tutorial steps completed and post tutorial questions answered, but I was not able to successful run all the tests required.
